With renv 0.16.0, [hadley/emo](https://github.com/hadley/emo) is installed as `"Source": "git"` because it uses submodules. (However, the submodules are used in `data-raw/` so they aren't needed for correct package installation.)

```{r}
getOption("repos")

str(renv:::renv_json_read("renv.lock")$Packages$emo)
```

The problem that arises is that I can't deploy content that uses emo installed with renv 0.16.0 to Connect because `rsconnect::writeManifest()` can't determine the repository URL.

```{r}
rsconnect::writeManifest(appPrimaryDoc = "example.Rmd")
```
